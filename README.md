# mParticle Javascript SDK

Hello! This is the public repo of the mParticle Javascript SDK. We've built the mParticle platform to take a new approach to web and mobile app data and the platform has grown to support 50+ services and SDKs, including developer tools, analytics, attribution, messaging, and advertising services. mParticle is designed to serve as the connector between all of these services - check out [our site](http://mparticle.com), or hit us at dev@mparticle.com to learn more.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation and other information about mParticle SDK can be found at [http://docs.mparticle.com](http://docs.mparticle.com)

## Usage

Once you have signed up to the mParticle platform and have a key for your App, you can begin to use the SDK by embedding the following
script tag in your web page, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your key.

```groovy
<script type="text/javascript">

(function (apiKey) {
    window.mParticle = window.mParticle || {};
    window.mParticle.config = window.mParticle.config || {};
    window.mParticle.config.rq = [];
    window.mParticle.ready = function (f) {
        window.mParticle.config.rq.push(f);
    };
    var mp = document.createElement('script');
    mp.type = 'text/javascript';
    mp.async = true;
    mp.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://jssdkcdns' : 'http://jssdkcdn') + '.mparticle.com/js/v1/' + apiKey + '/mparticle.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(mp, s);
})('YOUR_API_KEY');

</script>
```

You can then log events, for example, as follows:

```groovy
mParticle.logEvent('Play Movie', mParticle.EventType.Navigation, {'movie_length':'127 minutes','rating':'PG'});
```

## Creating an Integration

Similar to other mParticle SDKs, the Javascript SDK is able to automatically include, initialize, and delegate API calls to 3rd-party Javascript SDKs. If you would like to add your company as a new Javascript integration, reference the following integrations as examples:

- [AdChemix](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-adchemix)
- [Amplitude](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-amplitude)
- [Appboy](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-appboy)
- [Google Analytics](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-google-analytics)
- [Inspectlet](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-inspectlet)
- [Intercom](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-intercom)
- [Kahuna](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-kahuna)
- [KISSMetrics](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-kissmetrics)
- [SimpleReach](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-simplereach)
- [Optimizely](https://github.com/mParticle/integration-optimizely)

## Running the Tests

A suite of test cases can be run by serving the /test directory from a web server (such as [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)),
and pointing a web browser to index.html. This will execute the tests and also display code coverage results. Note that serving the test
directory from the file system directly will not work.
